My town's theme is the gates of Heaven. 
The large wheel angel (Ophanim) is based on artistic depictions of what the bible says that angels look like. 
In this project, the angel guards the gate of heaven and decides who gets to go to Heaven and who goes to Hell. 
Heaven is represented by the castle floating on a cloud.
